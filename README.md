# The Straight Framework v1.0 Nashville

The Straight Framework

An advanced, functional PHP micro framework for minimalists.

The framework consists of:

- a folder structure
- an htaccess file for routing
- a minimalist router function
- a function for retrieving and processing both settings as well as text
- a view function
- an utf8 user data escape function
- a basic query function

The Straight Framework has nothing to do with the Nashville pamflet but happens to
be released on the same date. Subsequent releases will be named after other Tennessee cities.
The name of the framework refers to the fact that it is very straightforward.
